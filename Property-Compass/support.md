## Getting Started

### How do I find the direction a property faces?

Simply enter the property's full address in the search box, then tap "Get Compass Directions". Our app will analyze the building's orientation using OpenStreetMap data and show you the exact compass direction (North, Northeast, East, etc.) along with the precise bearing in degrees.

### What information will I see in the results?

After searching for a property, you'll see:
- **Primary Direction**: The direction the property faces (e.g., North)
- **Exact Bearing**: Precise angle in degrees (0-360°)
- **Opposite Direction**: The back of the property
- **Left/Right Directions**: Perpendicular orientations
- **Elevation**: Height above sea level in feet
- **Interactive Map**: Visual representation with compass overlay
- **Nearby Places**: Restaurants, groceries, parks, hospitals, schools, banks, and pharmacies within 1 mile, organized by direction
- **Major Cities**: Cities with population over 10,000 within 50 miles, organized by direction

### Do I need to create an account?

Not at all! Property Compass works without any login or registration. Just open the app and start searching. Your recent searches are automatically saved on your device for quick access.

## Search & Results

### What types of addresses can I search?

You can search any US address including:
- Residential homes and apartments
- Commercial buildings and offices
- Public buildings and landmarks
- Any structure mapped in OpenStreetMap

Simply enter the full address (e.g., "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC") for best results.

### How accurate are the direction results?

Our algorithm uses precise geometric calculations and OpenStreetMap data to determine property orientation. The accuracy depends on:
- Quality of building data in OpenStreetMap
- Whether the building is properly mapped
- The building's proximity to the street

Always verify results using the interactive map view for complete understanding.

### Why am I seeing "No addresses found"?

This can happen if:
- The address has typos or is incomplete
- The property is very new and not yet in OpenStreetMap
- The address format is unusual
- You need to enter more details (street number, city, state)

Try entering the full address with street number, street name, city, and state for best results.

### What does "Direction shown is where the property faces perpendicular to street" mean?

This note reminds you that the compass shows the direction perpendicular to the street, which is typically the front facade. However, the main entrance door might face a different direction. Always check the interactive map to understand the property's complete orientation.

### Can I search addresses outside the United States?

While the app is optimized for US addresses, it can search properties worldwide as long as they're mapped in OpenStreetMap. Search suggestions are US-focused, but you can manually enter international addresses.

---

## Search Limits & Usage

### How many searches can I do per day?

You get 24 searches per day. This limit resets at midnight in your timezone. The app displays your remaining searches at the top of the screen.

### Why is there a daily search limit?

The limit helps us manage the free external APIs we use (OpenStreetMap, Nominatim, Open-Elevation) and prevent abuse. This ensures the app remains free and available for everyone.

### What happens when I run out of searches?

You'll see a message indicating you've reached your daily limit. Your search quota will reset at midnight, and you can search again. Your saved searches are always accessible without using quota.

### Do saved searches count against my daily limit?

No! Searching from your saved searches (recent addresses) doesn't use any of your daily quota. These cached results load instantly without making new API calls.

---

## Saved Searches & Cache

### How long are my searches saved?

Recent searches are automatically saved on your device for 3 days. You can access them instantly from the main screen without using your daily search quota.

### How do I delete saved searches?

Go to the Navigation menu (compass icon in top-left) → Settings → Saved Searches. You can delete individual addresses or clear all saved searches at once.

### Where is my search data stored?

- **Recent searches**: Stored locally on your device for 3 days
- **Search analytics**: Anonymously stored in Firebase for app improvements
- **No account data**: We don't store any personal information

---

## Map & Nearby Features

### How do I read the compass overlay on the map?

The interactive map shows your property with a compass overlay:
- **Green line**: Main direction the property faces (longest line)
- **Red line**: Opposite/back direction
- **Blue line**: Left perpendicular direction
- **Orange line**: Right perpendicular direction
- **Cardinal labels**: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW around the circle

### What nearby places does the app show?

The app displays amenities within 1 mile, organized by direction:
- **Restaurants**: Dining options
- **Grocery Stores**: Food shopping
- **Parks & Nature**: Green spaces
- **Hospitals**: Medical facilities
- **Schools**: Educational institutions
- **Banks**: Financial services
- **Pharmacies**: Medical supplies

### How are the "Major Cities" determined?

The app shows cities and towns within 50 miles that have a population over 10,000. They're organized by compass direction from your property, making it easy to understand the regional context.

---

## PDF Export

### How do I export my results to PDF?

After searching for a property, tap the red PDF icon button in the bottom-right corner. The app will generate a comprehensive report including:
- Property address and coordinates
- Direction and bearing information
- Elevation data
- Interactive map snapshot with compass
- Nearby places organized by direction
- Major cities within 50 miles

You can then share or save the PDF through your device's share sheet.

### Can I export multiple searches at once?

Currently, you can only export one property at a time. Generate a PDF for each property you want to save.

### Where are the PDF files saved?

The app uses your device's share functionality, so you can:
- Save to Files app (iOS) or Downloads (Android)
- Share via email, messaging apps
- Upload to cloud storage (iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Print directly

## Technical Questions

### Does the app work offline?

Partially. You can:
- ✅ View your saved searches (cached results)
- ✅ Access previously loaded maps
- ❌ Cannot search new addresses (requires internet)
- ❌ Cannot load new map data

### Why is the app asking for location permissions?

Property Compass does **NOT** request location permissions. You manually enter addresses to search—the app never tracks your real-time location.

### What data does the app collect?

The app collects:
- Addresses you search (for caching and analytics)
- Anonymous usage statistics (button taps, feature usage)
- Device info (OS version, timezone, region)

The app does **NOT** collect:
- Your name, email, or phone number
- Your real-time GPS location
- Personal identifiable information (PII)

See our [Privacy Policy](Privacy-Policy.md) for complete details.

### Which maps does the app use?

We use OpenStreetMap, a free, open-source mapping service maintained by a global community. Unlike Google Maps, OpenStreetMap is completely free and doesn't require user accounts.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### The app is stuck on "Searching..." or "Loading..."

Try these steps:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the address is entered correctly
3. Close and reopen the app
4. Make sure you haven't reached your daily search limit

If the problem persists, contact our support team.

### The direction seems incorrect

Remember:
- The direction shown is perpendicular to the street
- Main entrances may face different directions
- Always verify with the interactive map
- OSM data quality varies by location

If you believe there's an error in the building or street data, you can contribute corrections to OpenStreetMap directly.

### The app crashes when I tap a button

Please contact support with:
- Your device model and OS version
- The specific action that caused the crash
- Whether it happens consistently

We'll investigate and issue a fix as soon as possible.

### Nearby places or cities aren't showing

This can happen if:
- The area is rural with limited amenities nearby
- OpenStreetMap data is incomplete for your region
- There's a temporary connectivity issue

Try searching a different location to verify the feature works.
